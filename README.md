# Bank-Employee-portal

This project is a ''Bank Employee Portal'' developed using Java Swing for a GUI, providing login functionality for both admins and employees with file-based credential storage. Admins and employees have access to a dashboard featuring account management (adding, deducting funds, creating, deleting accounts), account display, a to-do list, emergency contact information, and transaction history (admin-only). The portal emphasizes easy navigation, role-based access, and a user-friendly interface for basic bank management operations.
